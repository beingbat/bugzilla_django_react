Current Issues (That will be tackled next):
- Any user can access employee list but that should be limited to the manager and admin (Can be limited using templates but goal is to block them through permission groups and views)
- Making Detail view of Employees
- Then will move towards project app. Project app will contain project, bug model according to current plan
